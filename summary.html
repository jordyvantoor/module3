        Here's a combined summary of Module 1 and the assignments:

        Module 1 focused on the concept of the trusted computing base (TCB) and its significance in secure computer systems. The TCB, which is primarily represented by the operating system, plays a critical role in protecting system resources. It must meet essential requirements, including tamper-proofing and complete mediation, to ensure the system's security.
        
        The module emphasized that trust in the TCB comes from both its functionality and its ability to perform its tasks effectively. While building a trustworthy TCB is complex, its correctness is crucial for system security.
        
        To delve deeper into the topic, several papers have been assigned for reading. "Reflections on Trusting Trust" by Ken Thompson explores the challenges of trusting systems, considering the need to trust not only the source code but also the toolchain and the people involved.
        
        Additionally, it is recommended to read the background and summary of the TCSEC (Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria) or Orange Book. Pay particular attention to the sections discussing the different divisions, classes, and reflections on its impact.
        
        These assigned papers will be essential for the upcoming quiz, which will test your understanding of their content. Moving forward, Module 2 will cover the design principles for secure systems.
        
        Enjoy your readings, and I look forward to seeing you in Module 2!

        In this module, we explored the role of hardware in achieving isolation and memory protection for the trusted computing base. We started by understanding the process of address translation from logical to physical addresses, which allows programs to work with logical addresses without being concerned about the underlying physical memory. Memory protection mechanisms, including protection level bits and page protection levels, were discussed to ensure the separation of operating system code and user code. Privileged instructions and different execution modes of the processor were introduced as crucial components of isolation. However, it was emphasized that trust in hardware is essential, as vulnerabilities in hardware and firmware can undermine the effectiveness of memory protection. The module concluded by highlighting the Intel developers' documentation as a recommended resource for further reading. In the next module, we will explore the concept of complete mediation and delve into virtualization.
