        This module introduces the topic of virtualization and its importance in secure computer systems. The goal is to understand what virtualization is, why it is significant for secure systems, and how it is implemented. The previous module covered the concept of a trusted computing base, which has three requirements: isolation or tamper proofing, complete mediation, and correctness. While hardware support for isolation was discussed in the last topic, this module focuses on achieving complete mediation and higher levels of correctness assurance through virtualization.

Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual representation of a full machine, going beyond the virtualization of physical resources performed by the operating system. It is an additional layer of software that provides a different interface or extends the existing one. In the context of security, virtualization helps address the requirements of isolation, complete mediation, and correctness for the trusted computing base.

The instructional team will be conducting virtual office hours and will respond to questions and inquiries sent via Piazza. The instructor will be responsible for quizzes, exams, and other aspects of the course. The next lesson will cover the useful background knowledge, assessment methods, and preparation needed to succeed in the class.

        Virtualization can contribute to building secure computer systems by providing a better interface for applications and enabling the protected sharing of physical resources. Virtualization allows applications to work with virtual resources, which are easier to manipulate and use compared to physical resources. User code interacts with virtual pointers or handles, while the actual mapping to physical resources is maintained within the trusted computing base (TCB). This mapping ensures complete mediation, as user code cannot directly access protected physical resources without going through the TCB.

An example of virtualization is virtual memory, where logical and linear addresses are translated to physical addresses by the TCB-controlled page tables. This mapping guarantees that user code cannot access portions of physical memory without intervention by the TCB. Similar mechanisms apply to file systems and network interfaces, where the TCB maintains control over the mappings between virtual and physical resources.

Virtualization helps address the third requirement for a trusted computing base, which is correctness, although it may not completely solve the problem. By reducing complexity and adopting principles of layering and modularity, the TCB can be made less complex. Full machine-level virtualization, where resources such as memory, IO, and CPU are multiplexed and managed by a virtual machine monitor (VMM) or hypervisor, contributes to this simplification. The VMM exposes the physical machine to guest operating systems and allocates and multiplexes resources among them. By separating resource allocation from resource management, the VMM becomes smaller and simpler, increasing the likelihood of correctness. This type of virtualization is known as Type I, which focuses on economy of mechanism and helps achieve both complete mediation and correctness.

In the next lesson, both Type I and Type II virtual machine monitors will be discussed in more detail.

        In the previous lesson, we discussed the importance of focusing on Type 1 virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hostless VMMs for building secure computer systems. We compared Type 1 VMMs with Type 2 VMMs, which are hosted on top of a host operating system. While Type 2 VMMs allow running applications from different operating systems, they do not simplify the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), which is the part of the system responsible for enforcing security.

On the other hand, Type 1 VMMs run directly on the physical machine or host and provide virtualization at the full machine level, including memory, CPU, and I/O. These VMMs support multiple virtual machines, each running a guest operating system and its applications. The VMM multiplexes the physical machine resources among the guest operating systems, leaving resource management and other tasks to the guest operating systems themselves. This separation of resource allocation and management makes the VMM simpler and reduces its complexity, improving the chances of achieving correctness.

Type 1 VMMs are more suitable for building secure computer systems because they simplify the TCB and offer better isolation and complete mediation. The VMM serves as the TCB, while the guest operating systems and applications run at lower privilege levels. System calls in Type 1 VMMs involve transferring control to the VMM, which then directs the system call to the appropriate guest operating system for processing. The VMM's primary task is resource allocation and partitioning, which results in a simpler and more correct TCB.

Examples of Type 1 VMMs include Xen, VMware ESX, Microsoft Hyper-V, and KVM in Linux. These hypervisors provide full machine virtualization and offer security benefits. Understanding the focus on Type 1 VMMs helps in comprehending the security advantages they provide and the implementation details, which will be discussed further in upcoming lessons.

        In the previous lesson, the speaker discussed the security benefits of Type 1 or hostless virtual machine monitors (VMMs), also known as hypervisors. They introduced the concept of "green" and "red" virtual machines to illustrate these benefits. The green virtual machine represents a trusted environment running important applications with access to sensitive data. On the other hand, the red virtual machine represents a separate environment for running potentially untrusted or experimental applications.

The purpose of using green and red virtual machines is to isolate potentially vulnerable or malicious applications from the trusted environment. If an application or the operating system in the red virtual machine gets exploited, the damage is limited to that particular virtual machine. The isolation provided by the VMM ensures that any malicious activity in the red virtual machine does not impact the green virtual machine.

The speaker addressed several questions regarding the impact of exploits and compromises in different scenarios. They concluded that a green virtual machine is not affected by the exploitation of a red virtual machine application. Similarly, a green virtual machine application is not affected by the compromise of the red virtual machine's guest operating system, as long as the VMM remains secure. However, if the VMM itself is compromised, the green virtual machine and its applications are also affected.

The speaker emphasized that a green virtual machine application not only needs to trust the VMM but also the guest operating system within the virtual machine. The guest operating system ensures separation between applications running within the green virtual machine, protecting them from potentially malicious applications within the same environment.

The overall benefit of using green and red virtual machines is the isolation and protection they provide. By running potentially vulnerable applications in a separate virtual machine, the trusted environment remains safeguarded. The isolation primarily relies on the security of the VMM.

The lesson concluded by highlighting the importance of focusing on Type 1 or hostless hypervisors and mentioning that future lessons will delve into implementation and further details on the topic.

        The implementation details of virtual machine monitors (VMMs) can be classified into two types of virtualization: full virtualization (hardware supported virtualization) and para-virtualization. These types of virtualization fulfill the requirements of VMMs, which can be divided into three categories.

1. Transparency: The VMM's role is to allocate and divide physical resources among virtual machines. Transparency ensures that the execution environment seen by a guest operating system is the same as if it were running on the physical machine, with the exception of performance degradation due to resource sharing.

2. Complete mediation: The VMM should control and mediate all access to physical resources by virtual machines. Without complete mediation, isolation across virtual machines cannot be guaranteed.

3. Efficiency: Most virtual machine instructions, which include guest operating system and user code instructions, should execute natively on the hardware. This means that the VMM should not introduce significant inefficiencies that hinder performance. However, certain privileged instructions, related to memory mapping, address translation, and virtualization-specific operations, need to be trapped and handled by the VMM.

In the past, Intel Pentium processors were not designed for virtualization, as they lacked privileged instructions. To address this, Intel and AMD introduced hardware modifications, such as Intel VT-x, to enable virtualization support.

If the hardware does not satisfy the virtualization requirements, a para-virtualization approach can be used. In para-virtualization, modifications are made to the guest operating system, and the operating system is recompiled to run in a different ring (e.g., not in ring 0) to accommodate the VMM's placement in ring 0. This modifies the transparency aspect of virtualization.

Paravirtualization can also be achieved by modifying sensitive but non-privileged instructions in the guest operating system code. Another approach, used by VMware, is binary rewriting, where code surrounding sensitive instructions is dynamically rewritten at runtime to trap to the VMM.

In summary, full virtualization aims to provide transparency and complete mediation without modifying the guest operating system, while para-virtualization involves modifying the guest operating system to achieve transparency while ensuring complete mediation.

        In this lesson, we discussed full virtualization and paravirtualization. Full virtualization is more desirable because it doesn't require changes to the guest operating systems. However, the Pentium architecture had instructions that posed challenges for full virtualization since they didn't trap to the virtual machine monitor (VMM). Paravirtualization could handle this by not using those instructions.

To enable full virtualization, hardware vendors like Intel and AMD worked on hardware support for virtualization. They introduced two modes: root mode and non-root mode. In both modes, there are four rings (rings 0-3), but the privileged instructions and certain registers are restricted in non-root mode. The guest operating system runs in ring 0 in non-root mode, but some instructions are only accessible in root mode, where the VMM operates.

The introduction of root and non-root modes changed the previous single mode with four rings. Root mode is designed for the VMM, while non-root mode allows the guest operating system to run in ring 0 and user code to run in ring 3. Control transitions between the VMM and virtual machines occur through VMEntry and VMExit. VMEntry transfers control from the VMM to the VM, while VMExit returns control to the VMM.

In root mode, the VMM runs in ring 0 (also called ring -1), which is more privileged than the other rings. The rings 1-3 in root mode are not used. VMExit can happen from ring 3 or ring 0, allowing tapping to the VMM. The guest operating system and user code still run in rings 0 and 3, respectively, in non-root mode.

The hardware changes for virtualization support the requirements of transparency, incomplete mediation, and performance. These changes enable type 1 VMMs or hypervisors to run unmodified guest operating systems.

In the next lesson, address translation and memory protection will be discussed in detail, focusing on how they are affected by the virtualization extensions.

        In this lesson, the speaker discussed the changes made to virtualization hardware by vendors and delved into the details of how the hardware functions and its alterations with the virtualization extensions. The focus was on memory protection and isolation achieved through the memory management unit (MMU) in the hardware. The speaker explained that the operating system (OS) running in ring 0 can believe that nothing has changed and can continue managing the logical-to-physical address mapping as it did before.

However, a problem arises because the virtual machine monitor (VMM) needs direct control of physical memory, while the OS should still believe it has access to physical memory. To solve this, the hardware (VT-x) introduces an additional level of interaction. The OS translates logical addresses to what is called guest physical addresses, which are not the real physical addresses. The VMM then controls the mapping of guest physical addresses to actual physical addresses using extended page tables (EPT).

The speaker provided a diagram illustrating the address translation process, starting from the virtual address generated by user instructions in the guest OS. The address goes through several levels of translation, involving the PML4, PDPT, PD, and page table structures. At each level, the guest physical address is translated to a physical address through the VMM's paging structures. Ultimately, the virtual address is translated to the corresponding real physical address.

The speaker mentioned that the translation process involves five guest physical addresses, which may appear to slow down the system. However, hardware features such as the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) help mitigate the performance impact. The key takeaway is that while the OS operates as if nothing has changed, the physical addresses it translates to are actually guest physical addresses, and the VMM handles the translation to real physical addresses.

By understanding both the OS's role and the VMM's role in the address translation process, one can gain a better appreciation for the implementation of virtualization. The speaker noted that in addition to the changes discussed, there are also extra instructions like VM entries and VM exits that enable full virtualization or hardware-supported virtualization, which is commonly used today.

        In the previous lesson, we discussed how hardware responded to the needs of virtualization through the VTX extensions. We established that the virtual machine monitor (VMM) is a trusted computing base and has access to all physical memory. However, there may be situations where the VMM or hypervisor cannot be trusted. To address this, Intel introduced a set of extensions called SGX (Software Guard Extensions) that provide protection for a portion of memory, even if the VMM is untrusted.

SGX allows the creation of enclaves within the address space of a host application. An enclave is a designated portion of the address space that enjoys special protection. The data within the enclave is stored in a separate portion of physical memory called the Enclave Page Cache (EPC). Access to the EPC memory is controlled, and only code executing within the enclave can access it. Anything generated outside the enclave is aborted and cannot access the enclave's data.

SGX provides hardware-based protection for enclave data, safeguarding it from non-enclave application code, the guest operating system, and even a compromised VMM. This hardware guarantee makes SGX an interesting addition because it offers protection without relying on trust in the VMM. This is different from previous discussions where VMM trust was crucial for protection to work correctly.

It's important to note that while virtualization systems, including VMMs, offer improved security by reducing the trusted computing base, they are not entirely immune to vulnerabilities and attacks. Hypervisors and VMMs have been targeted and have known vulnerabilities that can compromise isolation between virtual machines. Even SGX extensions have been subjected to attacks. Virtualization helps improve security, but it's essential to recognize that the problem of achieving fully secure systems has not been completely solved.

In some virtualization systems like Xen, the trusted computing base includes not only the VMM but also a special virtual machine called Dom 0 or service domain. Dom 0 runs at high privilege and is responsible for controlling other virtual machines and I/O operations. While it increases the TCB's size, it is still more controlled than a traditional operating system, as it only runs tools for virtualization management.

To deepen your understanding, it is recommended to research security vulnerabilities of virtualized systems and VMMs, as well as gain knowledge about the trusted computing base and its implications.

        In this module, we explored the topic of virtualization and its relevance to secure computer systems. We discussed how virtualization helps in building secure systems by reducing the trusted computing base (TCB) and providing complete mediation and isolation guarantees. The virtual machine monitor (VMM) plays a critical role as the TCB and simplifies the system, making it easier to achieve security.

We examined the concept of hardware support for virtualization, specifically the VTX extensions provided by Intel. These extensions allow the VMM to efficiently manage virtual machines by providing hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities.

Furthermore, we touched upon the idea of protecting sensitive data within virtualized environments. While the VMM is generally trusted, there are situations where it might not be. To address this, Intel introduced the Software Guard Extensions (SGX), which enable the creation of enclaves within the address space. Enclaves provide hardware protection for a designated portion of memory, even if the VMM cannot be trusted. This added hardware protection ensures that sensitive data remains secure even in the presence of compromised VMMs.

Additionally, we acknowledged that virtualization systems, including VMMs, are not impervious to vulnerabilities and attacks. While virtualization reduces the attack surface, VMMs can still have vulnerabilities that can compromise isolation between virtual machines. It is important to recognize the limitations and ongoing efforts to improve the security of virtualization systems.

Lastly, we briefly touched upon the connection between virtualization and threat intelligence. Virtualized systems, such as virtual machines, are used for dynamic analysis of malware to gain insights into their behavior. However, malware authors have become adept at detecting virtualized environments and evading observation. Transparent malware analysis systems, such as Ethan, leverage virtualization extensions to provide a transparent and scalable environment for conducting malware analysis.

Overall, this module introduced the fundamental concepts of virtualization, hardware support, protection of sensitive data, and the role of virtualization in threat intelligence.

        In this module on virtualization, we explored its importance in enhancing system security. We discussed how virtualization enables complete mediation and simplifies system design by virtualizing the entire machine. The smaller virtual machine monitor (VMM) in Type I hypervisors contributes to trustworthiness and correctness.

We delved into the requirements for implementing Type I VMMs and highlighted the role of hardware support, specifically the Intel VTX extensions, in meeting those requirements. We also touched upon the relevance of virtualization in cloud computing, where trusted VMMs are crucial for ensuring security and isolation between virtual machines belonging to different tenants. We briefly mentioned containers, such as Docker, which provide sandboxing but rely on the underlying operating system as the Trusted Computing Base.

To further explore the topic, we recommended reading the Zen paper to gain an understanding of virtualization basics and the Pentium paper to grasp the limitations and requirements for Type I hypervisors. Additionally, we suggested referring to Intel documentation, including the VT-x details, and reading the SGX paper to delve into the protection of sensitive data within virtualized environments.

Lastly, we mentioned the connection between virtualization and Threat Intelligence/Malware Analysis, urging you to review the relevant paper that explores the use of virtualization for transparent malware analysis.

With the virtualization module completed, we will now move on to the next topic of authentication, as it aligns with the progression of securing the trusted computing base.

Type I hypervisors are a kind of software that helps with virtualization and makes systems more trustworthy. Cloud computing relies on virtualization, and containers provide a way to separate software applications. The trusted computing base is the important part of the system that needs to be trusted. Reading certain papers and documentation will help you learn more about virtualization, and virtualization is also used to analyze malware. The next module will cover authentication, which is important for system security.
